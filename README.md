# 12 Months of aRt

This is the repository for my 12 Months of aRt project. Each month of 2019 I tackle a new generative/data art project. All of this work is done with R. Read more about it in my <a href="https://www.williamrchase.com/post/12-months-of-art/" target="_blank">project intro blog post</a>. There is a folder for each month that contains all of the code and art along with a readme to explain how to use the scripts. Each month also has an accompanying blog post which you can find below that explains the process and shows off many of the art pieces.

## May: orbital glyphs, part 2

This month I made several improvements to my glyph algorithms, and turned the whole thing into a package! You can find the package at <a href="https://github.com/will-r-chase/glyph" target="_blank">https://github.com/will-r-chase/glyph</a>

## June: artistic coding for the useR

This month I wrote a blog post summarizing what I've learned in the first half of my 12 Months of aRt project. The post includes a list of packages to help make aRt, tutorials and blogs to help you get started with aRt, and a list of people to follow on Twitter for inspiration.
